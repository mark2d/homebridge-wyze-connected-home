# homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op

This plugin adds support for Wyze Connected Home devices to [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

This plugin is an actively maintained fork of misenhower's original [Wyze Homebridge Plugin](https://github.com/misenhower/homebridge-wyze-connected-home) project.

## Supported Devices
- Light Bulb
- Color Bulb (Mesh Light)
- Plug
- Outdoor Plug
- V1 Contact Sensor
- V1 Motion Sensor
- Lock

For more information about our version updates, please check our [change log](CHANGELOG.md).

## Configuration

Use the settings UI in Homebridge Config UI X to configure your Wyze account, or manually add the following to the platforms section of your config file:

```js
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "WyzeConnectedHome",
      "name": "Wyze",
      "username": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
      "mfaCode": "YOUR_2FA_AUTHENTICATION_PIN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported devices will be discovered and added to Homebridge automatically.

### Optional fields

* **`mfaCode`** &ndash; Only required for the initial login if you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. This is typically a 6-digit code provided by your authenticator app.
* **`refreshInterval`** &ndash; Defines how often the status of the devices will be polled in milliseconds (e.g., `"refreshInterval": 5000` will check the status of your devices' status every 5 seconds). Defaults to 10 seconds.
* **`phoneId`** &ndash; The phone id used by the Wyze App. This value is just found by intercepting your phone's traffic. If no `phoneId` is specified, a default value will be used.
* **`userAgent`** &ndash; The browser user agent sent when communicating with Wyze services, as no browser user agent results in a 403 error. If no `userAgent` is specified, a default recent Safari user agent will be used.
